# ConfidenceBandsNonparametrics

I spotted two typos after submitting the application:
1. In equation (9), only the t-distributed random variable should be inside the absolute value signs.
2. In error design 4, the 2 in the exponent is missing. I am talking about the variance, not the standard deviation.
